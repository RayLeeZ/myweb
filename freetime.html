				<p> During my free time I tend to enjoy playing video games such as 
		Borderlands, Call of Duty, and Halo on my xbox. I also enjoy watching videos on 
		Youtube and shows on Hulu such as It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia
		and The Twilight Zone on my computer. Sometimes I draw stuff on my pc, 
		however, I am not the best at drawing considering I have access to a 
		mouse to do it with. Sometimes my parents need me to help them with stuff 
		like mowing the lawn or stacking wood outside which I usually do grudgingly.</p>
